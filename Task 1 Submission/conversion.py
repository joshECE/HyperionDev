Practical Task 3 --- `conversion.py`

Psuedocode:

Declare the variables as described in the
assignment sheet.

Assign each of the variables to themselves,
but modified using the correct typecast
e.g. `float()`, `int()`, etc.

Use multiple print statements to display each
of the numbers on separate lines.

# Declaring 4 variables and assigning them 
# values of different types.
num1 = 99.23
num2 = 23
num3 = 150
string1 = "100"

# Converting `num1` from a float to an integer.
num1 = int(num1)

# Converting `num2` from an integer to a float.
num2 = float(num2)

# Converting `num3` from an integer to a string.
num3 = str(num3)

# Converting `string1` from a string to an integer.
string1 = int(string1)

# Print out the 4 variables on separate lines.
print(num1)
print(num2)
print(num3)
print(string1)
